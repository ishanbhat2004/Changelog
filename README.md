# Changelog Generator

The **Changelog Generator** is a web application that allows users to generate and view changelogs for GitHub repositories. Users can input a repository URL and a starting point (commit or date) to generate a changelog. The application fetches commit logs from the repository, summarizes them using a language model, and displays the summarized changelog to the user.
